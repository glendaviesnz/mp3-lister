# Talk-lister
A simple front end app for listing a collections of mp3 recordings of talks - both individual and series. 

The main aim is to create an example of a simple React app that uses Context for state management, and at some point soon also play with the new Hooks to make it a fully classless app. Still very much a work in progress.
